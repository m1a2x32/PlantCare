# PlantCare
In today’s dynamic life people tend to ignore the idea of home growing your own produce. Even though this is cheaper, tastier, and possibly safer for your health, they prefer to buy fruits and vegetables from the shop without knowing what pesticides and grow methods have been used. The main reasons for this are the lack of time, lack of knowledge or confidence and lack of space to grow them yourself. The main aim of our product is to introduce a modern solution to these problems. With our product you won’t have to worry for anything but choosing what crops you will want to cultivate.
